Hello there! 👋

This is V.1 of my personal porfolio made in React and showcases my favorite past projects as well as links to both my GitHub and Twitter accounts. To me this site not only serves as a checkoint for myself to see how far I've come but also as a reminder for future goals I wish to accomplish.
